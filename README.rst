powerline-sanity
================

A saner set of themes for vim-powerline


colorscheme
===========

I've changed the default powerline theme to work better with me colorscheme of choice: sandydune_ (a fork of desert).

Issues I've resolved:

- The active window's status bar is the same colour as my window background colour. (Now it's lighter.)
- The red text for readonly and modified is hard to read. (Now it's orange.)
